# AbuseIPDB Bulk Checker

A simple and efficient tool to check multiple IP addresses against the AbuseIPDB API to retrieve information such as abuse confidence scores, ISP details, and more.

This project uses the **AbuseIPDB** API to help you identify suspicious or malicious IP addresses. It features a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Tkinter** for ease of use, allowing you to bulk check IP addresses, view detailed results, and track progress.
